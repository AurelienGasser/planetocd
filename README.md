[**Planet OCD**](https://www.planetocd.org/) is a website featuring articles about Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in foreign languages. 

The articles come from external sources and are translated from their original English version into foreign languages. The objective of Planet OCD is to spread quality and up-to-date information to non-English speakers, for free. 

Currently, only articles translated into _French_ are available. But other languages can be introduced (maybe by you? see the [Contribution Guide](./CONTRIBUTE.md)).
