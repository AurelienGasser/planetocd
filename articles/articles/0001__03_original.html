                        Previous articles in this series have focused on
                        religious Scrupulosity, which is most easily described as a pattern of
                        intrusive, unwanted thoughts related to one’s religious
                        beliefs. These unwanted thoughts are counter to the
                        sufferer’s faith, and lead them to perform compulsive
                        behaviors in an attempt to nullify or extinguish the
                        anxiety they experience related to these thoughts.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Conversely, the obsessions experienced in “moral”
                        Scrupulosity are focused not on matters of faith, but
                        rather on one’s personal sense of morals and ethics.
                        Those suffering with moral Scrupulosity experience
                        commonplace thoughts, feelings and actions that they
                        misinterpret as being evidence that they are ethically
                        flawed or morally bankrupt. As with all sub-types of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), those with moral Scrupulosity seek relief from their
                        anxiety through various compulsive and avoidant means in
                        an effort to ensure that their obsessive fears do not
                        come true. In other words, they perform compulsive
                        behaviors that they hope will prevent or eliminate the
                        feeling that they are a “bad” person.

                      <p>
                        Moral Scrupulosity presents unique challenges that make
                        treatment more ambiguous and difficult in contrast with
                        religious Scrupulosity. For example, religious faiths
                        have codified rules for approved beliefs and behaviors
                        that can be verified via scripture, or by consulting
                        with certain authority figures (priests, rabbis, imams,
                        etc.). Conversely, there are no fixed, objective
                        definitions of “good” and “bad”, or “right” and “wrong”.
                        In times of doubt, individuals with moral Scrupulosity
                        have no specific religious text or church elder to whom
                        they can turn for counsel. Their personal belief system
                        – their “moral compass” – is generally based not on
                        religious scripture or orthodoxy, but rather has
                        developed over time through their upbringing and
                        experience. Thus, for those with moral Scrupulosity,
                        determining precisely what is “right” or “wrong” can be
                        exponentially more difficult. At the same time, those
                        suffering with moral Scrupulosity often have a rigid,
                        perfectionistic belief that they
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline">must</span>
                        strictly adhere to their personal moral code in all
                        matters, regardless of the situation or context. Failure
                        to do so is often considered unacceptable, no matter how
                        slight the infraction.

                      <p>
                        As with all forms of OCD, the most effective treatment
                        for moral Scrupulosity is

                          >Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</a
                        >. The main <em>cognitive</em> tenet of CBT is that
                        irrational and unreasonable beliefs (known as
                        <em>cognitive distortions</em>) influence subsequent
                        feelings and behaviors. The central tool used in
                        correcting these faulty beliefs is
                        <em>Cognitive Restructuring</em>, which helps the
                        sufferer to gain a more realistic perspective in three
                        ways:

                        The goal of cognitive restructuring is to challenge and
                        replace irrational, fear-based beliefs with thoughts
                        that are more reasonable, realistic, and objective. For
                        example, one can challenge the belief that they should
                        never find anyone but their spouse attractive with a
                        more realistic thought that it is normal to find other
                        people attractive, and that what really matters is what
                        one chooses to do in response to those feelings.
                        Likewise, one can challenge the thought that they are a
                        cheater because they heard other students talking about
                        an exam by reminding themselves that they studied hard,
                        and already knew the answers to the questions that were
                        on the test.

                        It is worth noting that the process of cognitive
                        restructuring has the potential to become a compulsion
                        in its own right. &nbsp;When challenging your distorted
                        thinking, it is important that you not compulsively
                        review either your obsessive thoughts, or your cognitive
                        challenges to those thoughts. &nbsp;The goal is to
                        quickly establish whether a thought is in fact
                        distorted, and if so, to challenge it with a more
                        balanced thought. &nbsp;If you find yourself repeatedly
                        evaluating whether your cognitive challenge is “good” or
                        “right”, it’s a good bet that you are inadvertently
                        using cognitive restructuring as a compulsion.

                        Ultimately, the long-term goal of cognitive
                        restructuring is to stop blindly accepting the
                        irrational thoughts that present themselves to your
                        mind, and to instead develop a pattern of challenging
                        them. With conscious effort, your mind’s default
                        position will shift from unquestioning acceptance of
                        distorted thoughts to a more realistic way of thinking
                        that is based on reason rather than fear.

                        Common Challenges in Cognitive Restructuring for Moral
                        Scrupulosity
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Of course, this process is not as simple as it sounds.
                        The human mind loves to create disastrous scenarios, and
                        it is likely to take repeated effort over time to change
                        well-established thought patterns. Furthermore, reality
                        is not as cut-and-dried as logic. For example, take the
                        issue of driving no higher than the speed limit. Most
                        people would agree that, as part of being a responsible
                        member of society, it is generally a good idea to follow
                        traffic laws. And if you don’t, you may get a speeding
                        ticket with a hefty fine, or worse, have an avoidable
                        accident.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        However, in some situations it may be advisable to break
                        the law and go above the speed limit, such as in the
                        case of exceptionally fast moving freeway traffic. Even
                        the DMV would advise you match the average speed of
                        others on the road. In other situations, such as an
                        emergency drive to the hospital or some other
                        life-threatening scenario, driving faster than the
                        posted speed limit may actually be a matter of life and
                        death.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        These exceptions to the rule illustrate the grey-area
                        nature of real life. Simply put, there are some
                        situations where not being entirely “good” or “right” is
                        preferred, or even necessary. It is also worth noting
                        that bringing logic and reason to emotion may not always
                        change a feeling – try to reason your way into, or out
                        of, loving someone. Now imagine the difficulty of
                        challenging a thought for which there are no codified
                        laws, such as being honest with your spouse, or
                        exhibiting responsibility towards others.

                      <p>
                        As this suggests, given the inherent ambiguity of trying
                        to “live right”, challenging cognitive distortions will
                        only get one so far in managing moral Scrupulosity. As
                        noted above, in contrast to

                          >religious Scrupulosity</a
                        >, moral behavior has no standard doctrine for behavior
                        or belief. For example, a common belief is “It is wrong
                        to kill another person”. But in the case of war or
                        self-defense it may be necessary. Likewise, most people
                        believe it is wrong to steal. But if your family is
                        starving to death, stealing may be the most noble option
                        possible.

                      <p>
                        A more common moral ambiguity faced by many people in
                        America is the matter of “tipping” for services
                        rendered. By American standards, most people consider
                        tipping a “good” thing to do. However, there is no hard
                        and fast rule for the amount one should tip – 10%, 15%,
                        20%? If you ask ten people, you are likely to get ten
                        different opinions, including variations based on the
                        type of service being rendered, and how well the service
                        was provided.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But a person suffering with moral Scrupulosity may be
                        obsessively concerned with how much to tip, and with the
                        criteria by which that decision is made. Their belief is
                        that they
                        <span style="text-decoration: underline">must</span> tip
                        the “right” amount. It is a moral imperative.
                        Furthermore, their anxiety may be exacerbated by their
                        exaggerated fear of harming the person providing the
                        service – “what if the waiter can’t pay his rent because
                        of my tip being inadequate?”. All this concern over a
                        gesture that by all objective measures is optional.

                        The Role of Values In Cognitive Restructuring for Moral
                        Scrupulosity
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        Effective management of moral Scrupulosity ultimately
                        comes down to making choices based on one’s motivation
                        for action. In short, are your actions done because you
                        prefer acting a certain way, and prefer a certain
                        outcome, or because you are trying to avoid feelings of
                        distress and anxiety related to your irrational fears.
                        For individuals in the throes of moral Scrupulosity,
                        simple everyday decisions are often based not on choice,
                        but on fear. Do you tip 20% because it makes you feel
                        good to support the hard work of others, or because
                        tipping less would result in your feeling guilty,
                        anxious, or fearful? Since a firm standard does not
                        exist, it seems reasonable that one should act in
                        accordance with their true values, while accepting the
                        potential costs of upholding those values (such as
                        feeling short-term guilt, or worrying that others may
                        possibly think you’re stingy).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In order to guide your choices by your values, you first
                        need to evaluate both the intended action, and the
                        perceived consequences of alternative choices. If you
                        are suffering with moral Scrupulosity, consider asking
                        yourself these questions when faced with a situation in
                        which you are experiencing moral ambiguity:

                          which I have experienced this moral concern?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Objectively, what is actually the most likely outcome?

                          something different?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Who or what suffers if I make my choice based on my
                          fearful obsession?

                        <li>
                          What other possible choices can I can make in this
                          situation?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What about my choice do I actually care about and want
                          in my life?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Is my choice in this situation based on my true
                          values, or on my fear of experiencing anxiety or
                          discomfort?
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          What might I gain by choosing my action based on my
                          true values rather than on fear?
                        </li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>
                        Using these questions to evaluate a fear-based thought
                        can help you decide if that thought is a cognitive
                        distortion. And if your proposed action and its outcome
                        do not align with your life goals and values, you can
                        choose to instead accept the anxiety that comes with
                        experiencing your irrational, distorted thought. The
                        alternative – guiding your life with the goal of anxiety
                        avoidance – will typically lead to an abandonment of the
                        life you actually want.
