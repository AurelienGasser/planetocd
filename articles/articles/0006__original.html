      have to fear is fear itself.”

      >FDR’s famous line from his first inaugural address used to strike me as a
      universal truth. He describes fear as “nameless, unreasoning, unjustified
      terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.” I
      have interpreted this line as a call to be brave, to take on life fully,
      make &nbsp;the best of a difficult situation and count one’s blessings
      while doing so. The encouragement and sense of bravado inherent in FDR’s
      speech still strikes a strong cord in me.</span

      >I have sometimes translated the message for myself into “F*** fear,” and
      while it has fueled my natural rebelliousness, it also paints fear as
      something that should be eliminated or at least suppressed.</span

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >And then I became a therapist and began specializing in treating anxiety
      and especially Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. I was drawn to OCD work when
      I realized during my training that I had begun to struggle with OCD myself
      as a child but had hidden it from my parents and had never received help.
      So the cycle of obsessive anxiety-provoking thoughts and
      anxiety-relieving, but in their own way distressing, compulsions had
      accompanied me into adulthood. And now FDR’s warning about fear took on a
      different meaning.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >The fear of fear itself is at the heart of OCD’s vicious workings. For
      most people who live with OCD a rather random, unwanted thought or image
      pops up over and over again and creates anxiety. “My parents could die!”
      “I did not turn off the stove and the house will burn down!” “Maybe I’ll
      push somebody off the BART platform!” “If my hands are not perfectly
      clean, I’ll get sick and die.”
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >OCD thoughts come in these and many other strange, violent, sexual,
      superstitious, moralistic, and random shapes and sizes. Research shows
      that 90% of people have OCD-like thoughts but only 2% of people develop
      diagnosable OCD (which is still a significant number of folks). People
      without OCD are able to acknowledge these thoughts and move on, while
      people with OCD can’t shake them off and experience anxiety, distress and
      yes, fear, due to them. The thoughts become the truth, they predict the
      future, they describe reality. “I have a random thought about strangling
      my baby, so that must mean I will act on it.” It’s not hard to imagine how
      this line of internal reasoning can create terror and make life hell for a
      young parent who suffers from OCD.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >Compulsions then are efforts to neutralize these thoughts and relieve the
      fears they create. “If I check the stove just one (or ten, twenty, etc.)
      more time, I can be sure the house won’t burn down.” If I stay away from
      my baby, I can keep him safe.” “If I say a quick prayer, my mom won’t
      die.” And so the compulsions take on their own life. They are never
      enough, the obsessions keep popping up, the fear is right back, another
      compulsion has to happen.</span

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >From a learning theory perspective, the compulsions function as a
      negative reinforcement for the fear. &nbsp;That means they momentarily
      take away the anxiety, so the brain gets trained to keep wanting them.
      Fear in its natural function is a feeling that requires an immediate
      response. Fight, flight or freeze in the face of danger. A compulsion in
      OCD teaches the brain that there must have been a danger, otherwise there
      would not have been a need to react with a compulsion. And so the cycle
      keeps going.</span

  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >In this context the idea that fear is something to fear actually becomes
      problematic. It’s telling us that anxiety is intolerable, it should not be
      there because we can’t handle it. And that is exactly what OCD is all
      about.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >The most effective treatment approach for OCD (exposure and response
      prevention, ERP) involves exposures to exactly those feelings the
      compulsions are supposed to take away. “Experiential avoidance” is at the
      heart of the OCD cycle. Successful OCD treatment therefore helps a person
      to experience anxiety, uncertainty, discomfort, distress and to learn that
      they can tolerate these feelings and move forward through life without
      engaging in the compulsions. Mindfulness practices help us acknowledge
      obsessive thoughts without interpreting them as a reflection of a real
      danger. A beautiful image used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
      is that of the self as the sky with thoughts and feelings as events
      happening in the sky such as fireworks, clouds, planes, balloons, kites,
      etc. These events don’t fundamentally change the sky and they also pass
      by.</span

  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >Mindfulness can also help us learn to refocus when a thought is
      particularly sticky and distressing. We become able to accept and
      experience that a thought is just a thought, it is not a reflection of who
      we are and what will happen in our lives. Then we can develop the
      psychological flexibility to see it as the temporary, often random mental
      event it is. Now we can instead engage with a more helpful thought or
      activity and that, to use FDRs words, can “convert retreat into advance.”
      We can advance toward our goals in accord with our values.
    </span>

  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: 400"
      >Anxiety and fear are natural companions when we courageously take on
      life&nbsp;with our full vitality. We don’t have to be afraid of fear when
      we know we can tolerate it, and ideally even channel the energy these
      feelings provide to propel us forward. So instead of “F*** fear,” a new
      statement of encouragement can be “Dare to be Scared!”</span
