1. Cut out as many compulsions as you can.

7. Don’t put deadlines on recovery.
8. Stop trying to wish it away or longing for the time before you had OCD.
9. Stop repeating mantras or telling yourself constantly “it’s just a thought” this is compulsive.
10. Mum’s job is not to cure your OCD.
11. You don’t need to tell everyone about your OCD or have it as a username.  OCD is not our identity the same as asthma isn’t.  If you want to share in a non compulsive way that is fine, but only if you want to, not because you feel you NEED to.
12. There is no 🔑 to recovery which you will hear in one sentence and OCD will be unlocked and gone forever.

14. There are no supplements of diet plans that cure OCD.
15. Meds help take the edge off but won’t cure it.
16. OCD is usually misunderstood.
17. Mild OCD & Chronic OCD differ.  Chronic usually needs a deeper level of acceptance + understanding of OCD.
18. Thoughts are thoughts” often doesn’t cut it when OCD has been latched a long time with guilt & anxiety lingering latched in the background.
19. Mindfulness alone usually doesn’t cut if for long term recovery.
20. Fear is an illusion.
21. Avoidance is never the answer.
22. You can’t relabel a thought “an OCD thought” and move on when utterly convinced it’s real usually.
23. The exposure you put off is usually the most important recovery step.
24. Family and friends usually won’t understand OCD & you don’t NEED them to.  A bonus if they do not a necessity.
25. There is no such thing as treatment resistant OCD.
26. Recovery is a journey we walk alone, others can guide us but we have to walk it.  Taking responsibility for that is key.
27. Nobody owes us recovery.
28. Stop googling future cures, you have what you need now.
29. Exercise forms part of a healthy life structure.  Very helpful for recovery.
30. Life is short, be proactive, don’t keep putting off recovery.
31. Whoever you choose as a coach/therapist make sure they have a thorough understanding of OCD & haven’t just worked with mild OCD.
32. Persistence is the key ingredient.
33. Complaining is a zero return investment.
34. Progress is down to us.
35. We won’t notice progress instantly and often only see it when looking back.  Shifts are often small at times with leaps at others.
36.  Recovery isn’t linear, there are lots of peaks and troughs that level out over time.  Don’t forget though, some of our worse days follow our best days and vice versa.
37. Setbacks can happen at anytime.
38. Setbacks don’t equal square one.
39. Setbacks feel like you’ve never improved.
40. Approach recovery one day at a time.
41. Bring anxiety for the ride, don’t try and force it away.  Internally trying to rid or force it turns it up.
42. How you feel now doesn’t equal forever.
43. Your future self is thanking you for the work you are putting in today.
44. Recovery doesn’t happen on its own.
45. OCD doesn’t go away with age.
46. If you read a book finish it, don’t skim or jump book to book.
47. Don’t jump therapist to therapist looking for a quick fix.
48. Recovery isn’t a quick fix.
49. Recovery is not rocket science but takes longer than we usually want.
50. You’ve got this 💪🏻
